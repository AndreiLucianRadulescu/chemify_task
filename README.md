# Task managing RESTful API - by Andrei Radulescu.

I initially started by designing an actual web application, which didn't involve any endpoints and thus did not respect the requirements.
After that, I moved onto creating endpoints (which can be found in the __init__.py file). Also use JWT tokens for managing login sessions.

## NOTE: I did not remove the other parts of the website because it would take extra time, so please don't mind them (I refer to the routes, templates, etc.).
